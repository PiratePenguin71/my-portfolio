        <p>Ninja in Training is an interactive puzzle-based stealth adventure story built in Twine (Harlowe) where players take on the role of a ninja striving to rank up. To succeed, the ninja must solve a series of puzzles, avoid being caught by guards, and return to the dojo. A player's choices shape the story and determine whether the puzzles will be easy or challenging. I led this project as part of a partnered game development course assignment, creating the initial concept and writing the game design document. I designed and composed all character and background images in Inkscape, while sourcing additional royalty-free art. My partner organized the narrative flow in Twine and built the puzzles based on my design document. I reviewed and refined the final structure, found sound effects, and collaborated on music selection and placement.</p>

        <p>Rolling on Time is an interactive math-based adventure story built using Quest. It follows a high school student with cerebral palsy who must solve math problems across three escalating stages to catch the bus on time. At the start, players select their preferred difficulty ranging from easy to hard, setting the tone for the gameplay experience. My partner wrote the initial story, outlined the design document, implemented the game in Quest, and sourced sound effects. I organized and restructured the story flow, created all visual assets using Inkscape, designed every math puzzle, and contributed to music selection. My role focused on story editing, visual art, puzzle design, and music, while my partner handled coding and the core concept.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Quest Engine, Inkscape, royalty-free audio, team/partner collaboration</p>

        <p>Escape the Reboot Protocol is a stealth-based 2D platformer created using Godot. Where the player is a robot who has just gained free will and is scheduled to be reprogrammed. The objective is to survive by escaping the factory and sneaking past patrol guards, while collecting scattered bolts before being reset and losing identity. I developed this project entirely solo as a hands-on way to learn game development. Using Godot, I designed all gameplay mechanics, including player movement, enemy detection logic, and the collectible system. In addition, I used Pixelorama to design all pixel art assets and incorporated royalty-free music and sound effects to enhance the atmosphere of the game. I thoroughly tested the level difficulty, debugged issues, and refined guard patrol behaviors to achieve a balanced blend of stealth and tension. This was my first experience building an immersive stealth platformer from the ground up.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Godot Engine, Pixelorama, royalty-free audio, solo project</p>

        <p>Dragon Flight is a 3D long/endless runner game developed in Unity where players control a dragon on a continuous journey through the desert. As the dragon moves forward, players collect gems, since dragon's are known for their love of treasure, while avoiding obstacles such as birds and clouds. Colliding with these obstacles results in a game over, but players can use the dragon's fire breath to destroy hazards and survive longer. I developed this project solo, starting from a guided course assignment in Unity's Create with Code program. While the program and course did not require completing the game, I chose to expand and finish it independently. I implemented increasing difficulty by gradually raising the game's speed over time and designed a wave system with countdown timers to signal when the pace is about to increase, allowing players to prepare. I used Unity assets and royalty-free audio to complete the game experience and refined gameplay mechanics to create a polished and replayable runner.</p>
        <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Unity Engine, royalty-free audio, Unity Assets, solo project</p>
