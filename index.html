      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>I'm an aspiring game developer with a passion for game design, game mechanics and quality assurance. I enjoy the full process from concept to QA testing and I'm always eager to learn new tools and expand my skill set. I've created both solo and collaborative projects which include interactive stories and a 2D platformer. To bring these games to life, I've used tools such as Godot, Twine, Quest, Unity, Inkscape, and Pixelorama.</p>
